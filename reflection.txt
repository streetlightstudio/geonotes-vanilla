I start this assignment by creating initializing the repo with a basic index.html, styles.css and app.js file. I ensured to push the initial commit to github with the empty files to test the first (commit: d088076). I ran into an issue with the git commit -m "Initial commit" command which was not working as expected, which I realised was tied to my work account's SSH. The second commit included the basic UI for the application with a header, description section, landmark list section and a map container section. In the second commit (commit: 295ea5d), I encountered a logic bug where the map failed to display due to a mismatched map container ID between the HTML and JavaScript files. Debugging this issue reinforced the importance of consistent DOM element naming and careful attention to syntax when manipulating the DOM. Throughout the assignment, I experimented with progressively adding functionality such as form handling, event listeners, and dynamic marker creation, which improved my understanding of client-side JavaScript, browser APIs, and building interactive applications without relying on a backend.
